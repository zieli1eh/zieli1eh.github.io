        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a 20 year old Graphic Design student at Central Michigan University. I have been hoping to better my designing with the classes I've been taking but I still enjoy going back to drawing for fun rather than just school work. I would say my style falls into the discription of childlike and cartoonish. I have anyways been a fan of animation and colors that stand out. When I go further into being a graphic designer, I'd like to try and keep that style with me.</p>
